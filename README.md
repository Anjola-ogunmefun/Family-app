# Fastify-trial

My first trial using fastify frame work to create a CRUD app.

This code base is designed to interact with members of a family where it connects to a data base 
that makes it possible to add(create) a family member, get the list of all family members registered, 
find a member by email address, update a family member's details(by email) and finally Delete a member from the database(by email).
